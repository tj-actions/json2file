// The json2file library package provides a convenient way to write JSON data to file(s) using Rust.
//
// It includes a `write_outputs` function that takes input JSON data and a set of arguments specifying the output file(s) to write to, and writes the data to the specified file(s) in the specified format.
//
// This library is designed to be easy to use and flexible, with support for writing JSON data to multiple files in different formats, including JSON, and plain text.
